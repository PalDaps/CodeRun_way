Task: We have two strings. We need to calculate the minimum number of operations required to transform the 
first string into the second. The allowed operations are: delete any character, insert any character, 
replace any character. The minimum number of operations needed to obtain the second string from the first 
is called the Levenshtein distance.

class SolutionDp
{
public:
	int LevenshteinDistance(std::string First, std::string Second)
	{

	}

};

int main() 
{
	std::string First, Second;
	std::cin >> First >> Second;
