Task: We have an adjacency matrix, and we need to find the minimum distance from one point to another point, as specified 
by the user.

Idea: First, we check the closest neighbours and update their distances. Then, we continue checking their neighbours 
until we reach the minimum distance.

Solution: 

1. We use an array to store the distance to each vertex.
2. We use a queue to process the neighbours in order.

The main algorithm works as follows:

1. Remove the first element from the queue.
2. Look at all of its neighbours. If a neighbour has not yet been assigned a distance from the starting point, update it.
3. Add that neighbour to the queue so that its own neighbours can be explored later.

P.S. The only thing I donâ€™t understand is why here in if (AdjMatrix[Point][Neighbour]) we check the neighbours with respect 
to the row. What would change if we checked the neighbours with respect to the column?

Brainstorm:
